# SeniorProjectUnity2DRPG
Repo for our senior project, a 2D RPG made in Unity

For my team's senior project at EWU submitted in Winter 2022

My work consisted of the designing the Game Manager, Save Manager, Overworld (tilemap design, enemy and item placement, transistion areas, and the healing altar), Enemy Pathfinding, Quests, Sounds and Music (with area transisitons), 
Scene Transitions (New Game, Load Game, Quit Game), many hours of debugging/integrating systems as they were completed, and gameplay adjustments.

After cloning this repo, the containing folder should be openable with Unity. Select the "MainMenu" scene and start play from there to test.
