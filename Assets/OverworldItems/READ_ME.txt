Overworld Items v1

OverworldItems.cs can be attached to an NPC or any other interactable with a dialogue trigger to increment the amount of a assigned piece of equipment.

The OverworldItem prefab can be placed and assigned any Item prefab so that the player can pick it up (increment its amount) during gameplay.
