Main Menu v2 (now scales with screen size)

This is the entry scene for the game

It needs nicing up with art, but will be functional for now. 

New game needs uncommenting in script once new game scene is done. Looks for new game scene as "new game" so adjust if needed.

Load game needs the save/load scheme figured out, but is ready to be hooked up.

Quit functions currently, also works in the editor. To test, open scene and click play, then click quit game.
